# Traffic_Sign_Classifier
This project builds a convolutional neural network using the TensorFlow and the Keras libraries in Python.

Max pooling is used here, but refinements may be made using average pooling instead. There is also a dense layer using reLU activation, but
a softer activation function such as SoftPlus may also be a good option.
