# Traffic_Sign_Classifier
This project builds a convolutional neural network using the TensorFlow and the Keras libraries in Python.

Max pooling is used here, but refinements may be made using average pooling instead. There is also a dense layer using reLU activation, but
a softer activation function such as SoftPlus may also be a good option.

The script also takes in an optional command-line argument that specifies a file in which to save the neural network model. Mine is uploaded here for reference.

The data is collected form the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
